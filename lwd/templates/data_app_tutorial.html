            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2" style="margin-top: 0">for data scientists</h2>
            <p class="line"></p>
            <p class="bold-p">Data scientists are great at building models. We are even getting pretty good at creating
            nice <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>, but it can be difficult to make the transition
            from a static analysis to a dynamic web page that users can interact with. Obviously, not all data science
            problems need to be converted to a dynamic page, but it can be a very powerful tool to use when necessary.
            This goal of this post is to allow someone with little or no web background to create an interactive visualization.
            My hope is that the tools introduced in this post will easily generalize to other applications as well.</p>

            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Vagrant</h2>
            <p class="bold-p"><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is a nice tool that will allow us to all
            be developing on the same machine. First, install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>,
            which basically allows you to virtualize an entire new machine on your computer. Vagrant will leverage VirtualBox. Second,
            <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads">install</a> Vagrant. Now, go to your terminal and type:</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64;
    vagrant up;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">This will take a minute, but after it completes, you will now have access to an <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/">
                Ubuntu 14.04 machine.</a> Now run:</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    vagrant ssh;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">This will give you access to your new machine via the shell. </p>

            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Pip, Virtualenv, and Git</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">Let's go ahead and get some of our setup out of the way. We will be using
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>,
                and <a href="https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenv.</a> Git is a version control software
            that is amazingly useful. We won't use it much in this post, but if you are not familiar - definitely check it out.
            Pip is a package manager for Python. And virtualenv allows us to create virtual environments for Python in order to
            keep our dependencies separate from our core Python. Run the following in your Vagrant shell:</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    sudo apt-get update;
    sudo apt-get install python-pip git;

    mkdir app;
    cd app;

    sudo pip install virtualenv;
    git init;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">The first section of code is using apt-get, which uses Ubuntu's package management to install
            pip and git. The next section then creates a directory for our app and goes there. Lastly, we use pip to install
            virtualenv and initialize our git repository. Now let's put some actual Python libraries in our virtual environment.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    virtualenv venv;
    source venv/bin/activate;
    vi requirements.txt;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Here we are creating a virtual environment named venv, activating it (which means that
            now any packages installed will only go to this environment) and then opening vi to create requirements.txt.
            Vi is a text editor with an insert and command mode. Insert lets you type text. So hit <code>i</code> to
            go into insert mode and type <code>Flask</code>. Now hit <code>ESC</code> to exit insert mode and type
            <code>ZZ</code> to save and quit. We now have a requirements.txt file with Flask typed on the first line.
            Flask is a python library for microframework web development that we will use (more soon). We can now install it into our virtual environment with:</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    pip install -r requirements.txt;
    </code></pre>

            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Flask</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">Now that we have Flask, we can create a a basic "Hello World" web page. I won't be going
            into much detail for Flask, but the <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">
                    Flask Mega Tutorial</a> is awesome. Let's make a folder for our Flask application.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    mkdir flask_app;
    cd flask_app;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Now that we are in our flask_app folder, we are going to create two Python files:
            <code>__init__.py</code> and <code>views.py</code>. First, do <code>vi __init__.py</code> in the shell
            to create our file. To learn some more vi commands check out <a href="http://www.openvim.com/">OpenVim</a>.
            Insert the following into your file (remember to his <code>i</code> to go into insert mode and <code>ZZ</code>
                to save and quit)</p>
    <pre><code class="python"> 
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    from flask_app import views
    </code> </pre>
            <p class="bold-p">In Python, __init__.py makes Python treat our directory as a package and allows us to
                include some code. The code we included creates our Flask app and imports our views.
                Now follow the same process to create <code>views.py</code> with the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
    from flask_app import app

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return "Hello, World!"
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">This Python code will contain our views. Basically we define routes within our site
            and then under those routes are the Python functions that will get called when a user goes to that route. /
            is just the main page of the site. Our function just returns "Hello, World" for now.
                Now, let's create a <code>run.py</code> file in our root directory
            to launch our website.</p>
    <pre><code class="shell">
    cd ~/app;
    vi run.py;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Now put this code in the file - this just imports our flask app and runs it in debug mode.</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
    from lwd import app
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Now before we run our simple app, we will need to forward our vagrant ports. So type
            <code>exit</code> to exit our vagrant shell. You will now be in a directory with a <code>VagrantFile</code>.
            Open this file and add the following line (after <code>Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|</code>)</p>
    <pre><code class="bash">
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5000, host: 8080
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Save the file and then run <code>vagrant reload</code> to reload your vagrant box.
            Once this finishes, do <code>vagrant ssh</code> to go back to your box and type</p>
    <pre><code class="bash">
    cd ~/app;
    source venv/bin/activate;
    python run.py;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Now in your browser go to <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>. You should see Hello, World!</p>

            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">GitHub</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">Now that we have some things working, I recommend getting connected with GitHub. For those who are not
            familiar with Git, please check out this <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">introduction</a>.
            Also, if you are not familiar with GitHub, please see this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">guide</a>
            on how to create a repository. The repository is basically a place to store our code, so we can access in from anywhere (plus many other things).
            Before, creating our repository, lets create a .gitignore file in <code>home/vagran/app</code>. This file tells git to not track certain files or directories. We are going to add our <code>venv/</code> directory to this file. So use <code>vi</code> and type <code>venv/</code> on the first line. Now git will no longer track this folder. We don't need to track our virtual environment because it is pretty easy to re-create and it can add a lot of files to our git repository. Now, create your repository, no need to initialize a readme. Rather, follow the commands from GitHub under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" which will be shown to you right after you create your repository. This will have pushed your code to GitHub. So now if you look at your repository, you will see your code on GitHub!
            <br><br>
            Now you can easily backup your code to GitHub and share it with others. This is a great way to show people what you are up to and get involved in the open source community. If you are not familiar with the basics of git, here is a good <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">guide</a>. Commands that are frequently used are: <code>git commit, git add, git clone, git pull, git push, git status, git log</code>. </p>

            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Templates and Bootstrap</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">Now lets work on making our site look a bit better. First, lets create a <code>flask_app/templates</code>. This folder will store our html code. Also, we will start using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Bootstrap is a very popular web framework that basically makes it easy to create a nice looking site that works well on mobile. I won't spend much time going into Bootstrap, but there are a ton of guides online to get you started. In our new <code>templates</code> folder, create an <code>index.html</code> file. In this file put the following:</p>
    <pre><code class="html">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
        &lt;!-- The above 3 meta tags *must* come first in the head; any other head content must come *after* these tags --&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Bootstrap 101 Template&lt;/title&gt;

        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
        integrity="sha512-dTfge/zgoMYpP7QbHy4gWMEGsbsdZeCXz7irItjcC3sPUFtf0kuFbDz/ixG7ArTxmDjLXDmezHubeNikyKGVyQ==" 
        crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;

      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) --&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js" 
        integrity="sha512-K1qjQ+NcF2TYO/eI3M6v8EiNYZfA95pQumfvcVrTHtwQVDG+aHRqLi/ETn2uB+1JqwYqVG3LIvdm9lj6imS/pQ==" 
        crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;  
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Now go to your <code>views.py</code> file and replace it with this:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">
    from flask_app import app
    from flask import render_template

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return render_template("index.html") 
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">Basically what we have just done is updated our index view to render our new index.html template. And our index.html template now contains code to bring in the CSS and JS necessary for Bootstrap (from a remote location) and renders "Hello, world!" on our page. The CSS files are accessed using the link tag and the JS files using the script tag. You should notice that the text is now in a bit nicer font.</p>
            <p class="bold-p">JS or Javascript is basically the programming language of the web and code academy has a tutorial <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">here</a>. Code academy also has a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/htmlcss">CSS course</a>. Basically, CSS is what allows you to change the appearance of your site.</p>
            <p class="bold-p">Remember, that if you halted your vagrant machine, to run <code>vagrant up</code> and then <code>vagrant ssh</code> to get into the box. Make sure your code is up to date and run:</p>
    <pre><code class="bash">
    cd ~/app;
    source venv/bin/activate;
    python run.py;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">This is how you can continue to view updates to our site on <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>.
            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Bootstrap Themes</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">In case you are not happy with the standard Boostrap theme, there are many other options that are easy to use. For this tutorial I will use the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/simplex/">Simplex</a> theme from <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">bootswatch</a>. On this page, just right click on the download button for Simplex and select "Save Link As...". Save it as simplex_bootstrap.min.css which we will put in the <code>flask_app/static/css</code> folder (you will need to create the static/css folder). We can now replace:</p>
    <pre><code class="html">
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
    integrity="sha512-dTfge/zgoMYpP7QbHy4gWMEGsbsdZeCXz7irItjcC3sPUFtf0kuFbDz/ixG7ArTxmDjLXDmezHubeNikyKGVyQ==" 
    crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">With (in index.html):</p>
    <pre><code class="html">
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/simplex_bootstrap.min.css"&gt;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p">This will now use the CSS stylings from your downloaded file instead of the standard bootstrap CSS file we were getting from maxcdn (which basically just delivered the content over the internet instead of having us download it locally).</p>
            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Data</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">So we are supposed to be building a web app that uses data in someway, so let's get some data. We will be using data from New York City restaurant inspection results found <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59">here</a>. These data are exactly what they sound like, restaurant inspection results. I took these data and calculated the total number for each grade (A, B, C, ...) and saved it as JSON. JSON is basically the data format of the web (<a href="http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/">here</a> is some information on JSON if you are not familiar). You can find these data <a href="https://github.com/tfolkman/data_app_tutorial/blob/master/flask_app/static/data/grade_dist.json">here</a>. Save these data as <code>flask_app/static/data/grade_dist.json</code>.
            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Visualization</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">Alright - let's go ahead and visualize these data. We are going to use <a href="http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/">MetricsGraphics.js</a> from Mozilla. I really love this library. It is open source and built on top of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. I feel like it has a nice API that creates beautiful charts out of the box. It was originally built for time series data, but we are going to use it for a bar chart. Another nice charting library that is built on D3 is <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>. Download MetricsGraphics from <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/releases/tag/v2.7.0">here</a>. Once you un-archive the download, go into its dist folder. Copy metricsgraphics.css to <code>flask_app/static/css</code> and metricsgraphics.min.js to <code>flask_app/static/js</code>. Now let's change our <code>views.py</code> to this:
    <pre><code class="html">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
        &lt;!-- The above 3 meta tags *must* come first in the head; any other head content must come *after* these tags --&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;NY Food Grades&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/simplex_bootstrap.min.css"&gt;
        &lt;link href="/static/css/metricsgraphics.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Distribution of NY Food Grades&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p class="lead"&gt;All Cuisine Types&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div id='food-line-chart'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) --&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js" 
        integrity="sha512-K1qjQ+NcF2TYO/eI3M6v8EiNYZfA95pQumfvcVrTHtwQVDG+aHRqLi/ETn2uB+1JqwYqVG3LIvdm9lj6imS/pQ=="
        crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.0/d3.min.js' charset='utf-8'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="/static/js/metricsgraphics.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
        d3.json('/static/data/grade_dist.json', function(data) {
            MG.data_graphic({
                data: data,
                width: 650,
                height: 420,
                target: '#food-line-chart',
                chart_type: 'bar',
                bar_orientation: 'vertical',
                y_accessor: 'count',
                x_accessor: 'grade',
            })
        })
        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    </code></pre>
            <p class="bold-p"> Let's take a look at what is going on here. The <code>head</code> is bringing in our CSS files and defining our title (shows up on the tab). The body has a title and a sub-title for our graph as well as a <code>div</code> to hold our graph. Then we bring in all of our necessary JS files. Lastly, we define the javascript necessary for our chart. This script is using metricsgraphics.js and is surprisingly readable. The data: reads in our data, the target: tells it where to render the chart, and the accessor keys define the keys to use from our JSON data. If everything has gone well, you should see something like this:</p>
            <div class="row" style="height:500">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <img src="/static/images/data_app_1_ss.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-height:500px">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2 class="text-left bold-h2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="bold-p">Hopefully everything has gone smoothly for you! You can find everything on <a href="https://github.com/tfolkman/data_app_tutorial">GitHub</a> if you are having trouble. You will have noticed that I didn't go into much detail about each of the components. Instead, I tried to link to good resources. There are amazing resources on the web for almost all of this. I just didn't find much on putting everything together. I truly believe that having a decent set of web skills can be a great asset for data scientists. Being able to present your data or models in an interactive, attractive, and accessible way can be very powerful. Hopefully this tutorial will help you in building these skills.

            Also, this is just the first part in a series of posts I would like to do. I want to cover other technologies including PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Redis, React.js, and AJAX. If this sounds interesting to you, please let me know ( helps my motivation :) ). And, as always, if you found anything unclear or wrong in this post or just want to reach out, please do!
